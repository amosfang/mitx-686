# My MITx Micromasters in Statistics and Data Science Journey

## Background
I did my bachelor's and master's degree in Chemical Engineering with many numerical courses because I enjoy watching computers solve linear algebra in MATLAB and C++. If I had a a profession I could choose, it would be a role as a research scientist.

## 2023

In late February 2023, shortly after Chinese New Year, I decided to learn machine learning seriously from the best online course. Previously, I did many edX online courses and I know that the Micromasters in Statistics and Data Science is the hardest nut to crack. I took many years to complete 5 out of 6 courses from the MITx Micromasters in Supply Chain Management so I certainly had a history of struggling to complete certification programs and courses. Over the years, I have also learnt that certificatons are only as good as the value you can create by applying the knowledge, however in practice, it is harder to learn anything without being committed to a course so I decided to pursue courses again. This time round, I will do both courses and side projects so that I also learn by working on real world solutions.

As 2023 draws to an end, I decided to document my data science journey in order to stay motivated. Here are my achievements and misses.
